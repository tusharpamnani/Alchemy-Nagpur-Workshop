## Creating the Mint NFT Script

### Step 1: Create an Alchemy Provider using ethers

Open the repository from Part 1 in your favorite code editor (e.g. VSCode), and create a new file in the `scripts` folder called `mint-nft.js`. We will be using the `ethers` library from Part 1 to connect to the Alchemy Provider. Add the following code to the file:

```javascript mint-nft.js
require("dotenv").config();
const ethers = require("ethers");

// Get Alchemy API Key
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;

// Define an Alchemy Provider
const provider = new ethers.AlchemyProvider("sepolia", API_KEY);
```

Note that we are using `API_KEY` and not `API_URL`. Make sure you add this to your `.env` file so that it looks something like this:

```shell .env
API_URL = "https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key"
PRIVATE_KEY = "your-metamask-private-key"
API_KEY = "your-api-key"
```

### Step 2: Grab your contract ABI

The contract ABI (Application Binary Interface) is an interface to interact with our smart contract. You can learn more about Contract ABIs [here](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/guides/eth_getlogs#what-are-ab-is). Hardhat automatically generates an ABI for us and saves it in the `MyNFT.json` file. In order to use this we'll need to parse out the contents by adding the following code to the `mint-nft.js` file:

```json mint-nft.js
const contract = require("../artifacts/contracts/MyNFT.sol/MyNFT.json");
```

If you want to see the ABI you can print it to your console:

```shell shell
console.log(JSON.stringify(contract.abi));
```

To run and see your ABI printed to the console navigate to your terminal and run

```shell shell
node scripts/mint-nft.js
```

### Step 3: Configure the metadata of your NFT using IPFS

Our `mintNFT` smart contract function takes in a `tokenURI` parameter that should resolve to a JSON document describing the NFT's metadataâ€” which is really what brings the NFT to life, allowing it to have configurable properties, such as a name, description, image, and other attributes.

> Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.

We will use [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud), a convenient IPFS API and toolkit, to store our NFT asset and metadata and ensure that our NFT is truly decentralized. If you don't have a Pinata account, sign up for a free account [here](https://pinata.cloud/signup).

Once you've created an account:

- Navigate to the _Pinata Upload_ button on the top right
- Upload an image to pinata - this will be the image asset for your NFT. Feel free to name the asset whatever you wish
- After you upload, at the top of the page, there should be a green popup that allows you to view the hash of your upload â€”> Copy that hashcode. You can view your upload at: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/\<image-hash-code>](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeib2c52isjla2vwdbqicqmbhiklp7v3ih5hwiswqkosrpndcxlcgy4)

For the more visual learners, the steps above are summarized here: Now, we're going to want to upload one more document to Pinata. But before we do that, we need to create it!

In your root directory, make a new file called nft-metadata.json and add the following json code:

<!--  -->

```json nft-metadata.json
{
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Event",
      "value": "Ship_It_On_Story"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "City",
      "value": "Nagpur"
    }
  ],
  "description": "This was an event by CentralDAO in Nagpur",
  "image": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeib2c52isjla2vwdbqicqmbhiklp7v3ih5hwiswqkosrpndcxlcgy4",
  "name": "Tushar"
}
```

<!--  -->

Feel free to change the data in the json. You can add or remove attributes. Most importantly, make sure the image field points to the location of your IPFS imageâ€” otherwise, your NFT will not include a photo of a (very cute!) dog.

Once you're done editing the json file, save it and upload it to Pinata, following the same steps we did for uploading the image.

### Step 4: Create a Signer and an Instance of the Contract

In order to be able to call the functions on our deployed contract, we need to define an ethers `Signer` using our wallet's private key. Next, we need to use the contract's deployed address, the contract ABI, and the aforementioned signer to define a `contract` instance.

In the `mint-nft.js` file, add the following code:

```javascript mint-nft.js
// Create a signer
const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

// Get contract ABI and address
const abi = contract.abi;
const contractAddress = "0x354EcEb2bd747ec0d4acC370b77Fe28415F4f220";

// Create a contract instance
const myNftContract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, signer);
```

In the snippet above, you can see that our contract's deployed address is `0x354EcEb2bd747ec0d4acC370b77Fe28415F4f220`. If you don't remember your contract address or can't find it on Etherscan, simply re-deploy the contract from Part 1 again and note down the new address.

### Step 5: Call mintNFT function of the contract

Remember the metadata.json you uploaded to Pinata? Get its hashcode from Pinata and pass the following into a call to `mintNFT` [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/\<metadata-hash-code>](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/%3Chash-code%3E)

Here's how to get the hashcode:

<Warning>
  Double check that the hashcode you copied links to your **metadata.json** by loading [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/\<metadata-hash-code>](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/%3Chash-code%3E) into a separate window. The page should look similar to the screenshot below:
</Warning>

![](https://prod.ferndocs.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.buildwithfern.com%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Falchemy.docs.buildwithfern.com%2Fdocs%2F2025-07-16T20%3A14%3A47.594Z%2Ftutorials%2Fcreating-smart-contracts%2Fhow-to-create-an-nft-on-ethereum-tutorial%2F491013b-image_19.png&w=3840&q=75)

Now add the following piece of code to `mint-nft.js` to call the `mintNFT` function:

```javascript mint-nft.js
// Get the NFT Metadata IPFS URL
const tokenUri =
  "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreibytsze3xenwgums3xqwnx5d4qoydezt4pcxzzpodomxcsdhhlavu";

// Call mintNFT function
const mintNFT = async () => {
  let nftTxn = await myNftContract.mintNFT(signer.address, tokenUri);
  await nftTxn.wait();
  console.log(
    `NFT Minted! Check it out at: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/${nftTxn.hash}`
  );
};

mintNFT()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

The final `mint-nft.js` file should look something like this:

```javascript mint-nft.js
require("dotenv").config();
const ethers = require("ethers");

// Get Alchemy App URL
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;

// Define an Alchemy Provider
const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider("sepolia", API_KEY);

// Get contract ABI file
const contract = require("../artifacts/contracts/MyNFT.sol/MyNFT.json");

// Create a signer
const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

// Get contract ABI and address
const abi = contract.abi;
const contractAddress = "0x354EcEb2bd747ec0d4acC370b77Fe28415F4f220";

// Create a contract instance
const myNftContract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, signer);

// Get the NFT Metadata IPFS URL
const tokenUri =
  "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreibytsze3xenwgums3xqwnx5d4qoydezt4pcxzzpodomxcsdhhlavu";

// Call mintNFT function
const mintNFT = async () => {
  let nftTxn = await myNftContract.mintNFT(signer.address, tokenUri);
  await nftTxn.wait();
  console.log(
    `NFT Minted! Check it out at: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/${nftTxn.hash}`
  );
};

mintNFT()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

We're all set. Let's mint our NFT by running the following command:

```shell shell
node scripts/mint-nft.js
```

You should get an output that looks something like this:

```shell shell
NFT Minted! Check it out at: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x721adae139222cfa5743836e66ce422e61c1b07fd3d16d1fc822f2dd0b5153cc
```

You can check out your NFT mint on Etherscan by following the URL above.

You can view your NFT on OpenSea by searching for your contract address. Check out [our NFT here](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/mynft-15112).

Using the `mint-nft.js` you can mint as many NFT's as your heart (and wallet) desires! Just be sure to pass in a new `tokenURI` describing the NFT's metadata --otherwise, you'll just end up making a bunch of identical ones with different IDs.

Presumably, you'd like to be able to show off your NFT in your wallet ðŸ˜‰â€” so be sure to check out Part III: [How to View Your NFT in Your Wallet](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-a-nft-smart-contract/how-to-view-your-nft-in-your-wallet).
